PhoneBuddy helps you interface with your smartphone from any SMS-capable device - which we will refer to as your buddy phone.

PhoneBuddy lets you receive SMS and push notifications from apps like Twitter and Facebook on your buddy phone. In addition, you can also send text messages using your smartphone's SIM card from your buddy phone.

Perfect for those times when you really need to send a text message out in public, but don't want to risk getting your precious smartphone stolen, or when you're having a lazy day and can't be bothered to reach for your smartphone from your bed.

Your buddy phone lets you keep up to date with what's happening, without having to bring out your smartphone.
