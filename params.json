In addition, you can also send text messages using your smartphone's SIM card from your buddy phone.\r\n\r\nPerfect for those times when you really need to send a text message out in public, but don't want to risk getting your precious smartphone stolen, or when you're having a lazy day and can't be bothered to reach for your smartphone from your bed.\r\n\r\nYour buddy phone lets you keep up to date with what's happening, without having to bring out your smartphone.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--ScnfrzZHHXk7sVfJ8Nf4k5FEfgXTWl9yfXC1l9_ZvT9OvLttb4Gp0zM1p9AXTcimk=h900-rw\" width=\"300px\" />\r\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uE1Z9X-HtbKYZczXkZZXeRpGbgRenU21HuhLGg0em8Om08L7_gwZI_y900jSEIuNMA=h900-rw\" width=\"300px\" />\r\n\r\n## Building PhoneBuddy\r\nClone the repository.\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/beauties-beast/phonebuddy.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun gradle sync in order to download the open source libraries used.\r\n\r\nStart building!\r\n\r\n## Open Source Libraries Used\r\n\r\n* [CardsLib](https://github.com/gabrielemariotti/cardslib) by Gabriele Mariotti\r\n* [AppIntro](https://github.com/PaoloRotolo/AppIntro) by Paolo Rotolo\r\n\r\n## About PhoneBuddy\r\n\r\nPhoneBuddy is developed by [Boggs Aldanese](http://boggs.xyz), [Deanne Chan](https://github.com/deannechan), and [Via Sido](https://github.com/viaaasido).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
